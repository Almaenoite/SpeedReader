# SpeedReader

SpeedReader is a Tkinter app I built as my final project for Codedex. The aim of the app is to help people read faster. After the launch, a window will appear. In this window, copy and paste your text, then click the "Enter" button. Another window will appear with your text displayed word by word. The words will advance automatically, and you can control the speed using the horizontal slider.

## Requirements

### For linux
You must at least install make and docker

### For windows
You must at least install docker

## How to launch the application

### For linux
To launch the app, simply type "make" in your terminal. This will create a Docker image and execute it. Don't forget to remove the image when you're finished by typing "make clean" in your terminal. If an issue occurs during the compilation, you can type "make re" to reset the process and start a fresh new one.

### For windows
To launch the app, simply type "./Make.sh" in your terminal. This will create a Docker image and execute it. Don't forget to remove the image when you're finished by typing "./Make clean" in your terminal. If an issue occurs during the compilation, you can type "./Make re" to reset the process and start a fresh new one.

## Thank you for take time to see my project, I hope it will help.
